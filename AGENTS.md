## Verify
- This repo is an AwesomeWM config, not a package/workspace repo. There are no repo-local test, lint, formatter, or CI configs to run.
- The only verified fast check in-repo is `awesome -k rc.lua` from the repo root. It catches config load/syntax issues, but not missing desktop binaries or live screen behavior.

## Entry Point
- `rc.lua` is the real entrypoint, and its require order is intentional.
- `src.theme.user_variables` defines global `user_vars`; `src.theme.init` defines global `Theme` and `Theme_path`; `src.core.signals` defines global `Hover_signal`. Many later modules assume those globals already exist.
- Add screen UI in `radical_wm/init.lua`, not `rc.lua`, unless it must happen before screen setup.

## Structure
- `src/core/`: startup behavior, rules, notifications, shared signals.
- `src/theme/`: theme globals and user-tunable settings. `.luarc.json` targets Lua 5.3 and points language tooling at `/usr/share/awesome/lib`.
- `src/widgets/`: leaf widgets; many shell out to external Linux desktop tools.
- `src/modules/`: popups, OSDs, controllers.
- `mappings/`: root/client key and mouse bindings.
- `radical_wm/`: actual bar/popup composition. Edit the non-backup files that `radical_wm/init.lua` requires; ignore `*_backup.lua` and `*.backup.lua` unless the user explicitly wants them touched.

## Repo Gotchas
- Globals are part of the design here. Do not “clean up” `user_vars`, `Theme`, `Theme_path`, or `Hover_signal` into locals without updating consumers across the repo.
- `radical_wm/init.lua` is screen-specific: screen 1 is minimal, screen 2 gets the main `radical_bar`, `right_bar`, `center_bar`, and dock.
- `mappings/bind_to_tags.lua` binds keys for tags 1..9, but `radical_wm/init.lua` currently creates 4 named tags. Treat tag-count changes as coordinated edits.
- Floating rules are partly data-driven: `src/core/rules.lua` loads `src/assets/rules.txt`, and `mappings/global_keys.lua` appends/removes classes in that same file at runtime.
- Path handling is mixed. Most assets use `awful.util.getdir("config")` or `gears.filesystem.get_configuration_dir()`, but some shell snippets hardcode `~/.config/awesome`.
- `src/widgets/plano_gif.lua` preloads `src/assets/logo.gif` at startup and caches extracted frames under `/tmp/awesome_plano_gif_frames/`. Stale cache can affect GIF-related changes.
- `radical_wm/radical_bar.lua` recolors child widgets unless they set `_preserve_colors` or `_preserve_segment`. Set one of those flags for widgets that must keep their own colors.
- Widget behavior depends on external desktop commands such as `rofi`, `pactl`, `playerctl`, `iw`, `ping`, `pkexec xfpm-power-backlight-helper`, and ImageMagick `convert`. Preserve those shell command contracts when editing related widgets.
